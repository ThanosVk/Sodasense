Sodasense is a mobile application for Android and IOS made with Flutter that register and manage user's location and movement data. The application provides multiple screen for viewing the user's daily steps, a map that the user can see the current location and the route that is registered (by a specific day or by several days), a screen with a compass that shows the heading of the device, the address based on the user's current location with the city, postal code, country, longitude, latitude and the altitude.
